# To-Do-List
A To-Do List project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to add, remove, and manage tasks efficiently. Users can input tasks they wish to remember for the day and check or uncheck them as completed. The app includes dedicated buttons for adding and deleting tasks, enhancing user interaction. It stores the task data in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks remain intact even after the browser is closed, allowing users to view their tasks later for convenience and productivity.
